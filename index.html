  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-1 col-md-1">
        <h2 class="one">Root</h2>
        <p id="p1">
        A blocked root chakra can manifest as physical issues like arthritis, constipation, and bladder or colon problems, or
        emotionally through feeling insecure about finances or our basic needs and well-being. When it’s in alignment and open,
        we will feel grounded and secure, both physically and emotionally.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-2 col-md-2">
        <h2 class="two">Sacral</h2>
        <p id="p2">Issues with this chakra can be seen via problems with the associated organs, like urinary tract infections, lower back
      pain, and impotency. Emotionally, this chakra is connected to our feelings of self-worth, and even more specifically,
      our self-worth around pleasure, sexuality, and creativity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3">
        <h2 class="three">Solar plexus</h2>
        <p id="p3">Blockages in the third chakra are often experienced through digestive issues like ulcers, heartburn, eating disorders,
      and indigestion. It’s the chakra of our personal power. This means it’s related to our self-esteem and self-confidence.
